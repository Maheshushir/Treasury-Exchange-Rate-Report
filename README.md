# TREASURY EXCHANGE RATE REPORT: POWER BI DASHBOARD 
# [SEP 30 2024 - OCT 31 2024]

This dashboard visualizes the treasury report covering 93 currencies worldwide. The initial phases involve data preparation and the dashboard and KPIs are my individual work. From the analysis, I found the following insights:

1] Currency Valuation: Significant variations exist in the value of different currencies against the USD. For instance, the Afghan Afghani (AFN) is at 68.46 AFN per USD, while the Japanese Yen (JPY) is at 142.47 JPY per USD, showing that it takes more Yen to equal one dollar than Afghani.
High-Value Currencies: Some currencies are strong against the USD. The Kuwaiti Dinar (KWD) is among the highest valued at 0.305 KWD per USD, indicating its strength. Similarly, the Bahraini Dinar (BHD) is valued at 0.377 BHD per USD, showing robust purchasing power.

2] Depreciated Currencies: Weaker currencies compared to the USD include the Venezuelan Bol√≠var (VES), currently at 36.816 VES per USD, reflecting extreme inflation or depreciation and ongoing economic challenges in Venezuela.

3] Diverse Currency Tiers: The data shows a tiered currency structure. Currencies from developed nations, like the Euro at 0.893 EUR per USD, are stable compared to those from developing economies. For example, the Brazilian Real (BRL) is at 5.434 BRL per USD, reflecting Brazil's economic conditions.

4] Regional Trends: Regional trends in currency values are evident. African currencies like the CFA Franc (around 585.75 CFA per USD) suggest a pegged arrangement. Meanwhile, the Indian Rupee (INR) is influenced by national policies at 83.767 INR per USD.

5] Importance of Exchange Rates: These rates are crucial for businesses in international trade, financial planning, and investments. Companies must consider these rates for pricing goods and services and managing currency fluctuations to optimize profits.

6] Inflation and Currency Value: Countries with hyperinflation show drastic changes in currency values. This is evident in the Argentine Peso (ARS), where the rate is 989.5 ARS per USD, signaling economic volatility.
Market Implications: Exchange rates indicate economic health. A strong currency usually suggests a robust economy, while a weak currency indicates economic difficulties and trade imbalances.
